# LinkedIn Post Draft: Gmail Integration Complete

📧 My AI Employee Just Got Smarter - Gmail Integration Live!

Just connected my AI assistant to Gmail API and the results are impressive.
In the first run, it processed 9 emails in seconds:

✅ Auto-categorized: Security alerts, newsletters, GitHub notifications
✅ Filtered noise: No spam reached my attention
✅ Created action items: Important emails → Obsidian tasks
✅ Human oversight: Every decision visible in dashboard

The best part? It runs 24/7. Wake up to a clean inbox with only items
that actually need your attention.

Next milestone: Adding MCP servers to enable actual email responses
(with approval, of course).

For anyone drowning in emails - what's your current triage system?
