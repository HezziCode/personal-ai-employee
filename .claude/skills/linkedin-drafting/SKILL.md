   - `vault/Dashboard.md` - Recent activity, achievements

2. **Generate Post**
   - Length: 150-200 words
   - Tone: Professional yet conversational
   - Structure: Hook → Body → CTA
   - Hashtags: 3-5 relevant tags
   - Emojis: Maximum 2 (hook or section breaks only)

3. **Save Draft**

   - Location: `vault/Social_Media/LinkedIn_Drafts/`
   - Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD_[topic-slug].md`
   - Format: YAML frontmatter + post content + instructions
