# LinkedIn Post Draft: Silver Tier Complete

🎯 Silver Tier Unlocked - AI Employee Getting Smarter!

Just wrapped up the Silver tier of my Personal AI Employee hackathon.
Here's what's now automated:

✅ Gmail API integration (9 emails processed automatically)
✅ Smart categorization (security, newsletters, urgent items)
✅ LinkedIn draft generation (this post was AI-assisted!)
✅ Human-in-the-loop safety checks

The system now monitors my inbox 24/7, creates actionable tasks in Obsidian,
and even helps me stay active on LinkedIn - all while keeping me in control.

Next challenge: MCP servers for actual email sending + scheduling automation.

What part of your daily workflow would you automate first if you could?
