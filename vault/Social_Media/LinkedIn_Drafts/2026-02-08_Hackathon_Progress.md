# LinkedIn Post Draft: Hackathon Progress

🚀 Building My First AI Employee - Silver Tier Unlocked!

Just completed the Gmail integration for my Personal AI Employee project.
Here's what's working:

✅ Automated email detection (Gmail API)
✅ Smart categorization (security alerts, newsletters, important)
✅ Action item generation in Obsidian dashboard
✅ Human-in-the-loop approvals for safety

The AI now processes 9 emails in seconds, categorizes them, and creates
actionable tasks - all while maintaining human oversight.

Next challenge: LinkedIn auto-drafting (this post style!) and MCP servers
for actual email sending.

What's the most tedious part of your workflow you'd love to automate?
